Call the number of values $> a_0$ to be $m$. Then when we move $a_0$ to the back, the inversion values will increase by $m$ (as these $m$ values will have an additional value smaller but stay after them in the list). However, there will still be $n-1-m$ values smaller than $a_0$. Then inversions value will decrease by $n-1-m$ (as $a_0$ initially has these $n-1-m$ values smaller but stay after  in the list, but not anymore). $$\\Rightarrow inversion\\_values = inversion\\_values + m - (n-1-m) = inversion_values + 2m - (n-1)$$As $n$ even, $n-1$ is odd => inversion values change by an odd amount.

For each configuration, we measure the number of steps to reach these relaxed state and choose the max of those 2 values. These 2 are relaxed problems for the real goal, and they don't overestimate the number of steps. We will also calculate the costs at possible states and store them in a dictionary.

In total for 2 databases are 30240 data points. Storing and calculating the $solve\\_sub\\_Puzzle$ for each step is already a lot for memory and time. If we extend for 4x4 and we do 7-8 separations plus the empty tile: in total, we'll have: $16P8 + 16P9 = 518918400 + 4151347200 = 4670265600 $. 4.6 Billion data cases to run and to store is too much to handle. Hence, this approach for pattern database is only efficient for 3*3 or smaller."
